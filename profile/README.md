## ABOUT US
Our lab group examines the genomics and ecology of plant-associated microbes to better understand the factors driving successful plant colonization and the many impacts that microbes have on plant health.  
<br/>

## CURRENT RESEARCH TOPICS
1. The biology of two vascular bacterial pathogens, *Erwinia tracheiphila* and *Serratia marcescens*
2. The mechanisms driving the assembly of microbiomes on roots in the presence and absence of abiotic stress
3. The roles of light-sensing and environmental stress in the ecological fitness of the foliar pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae*
